# IRT-Tools
Tools for Incident Response Teams

This project was born to deal with the increasing number of users sending us suspicious emails for analysis (containing either malicious links or attachments or both ). The task became more ardous and painful since we were using Proofpoint, so we needed to manually disentangle all the stuff added to URLs by Proofpoint before even start the analysis.

So I first created created a powershell script to help me out on this (can be found here) and later an Outlook AddIn.

more to come...
