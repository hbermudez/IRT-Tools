# IRT-Tools
Tools for Incident Response Teams

This project was born to deal with the increasing number of users sending us suspicious emails for analysis (containing either malicious links or attachments or both ). The task became more ardous and painful since we were using Proofpoint, so we needed to manually disentangle all the stuff added to URLs by Proofpoint before even start the analysis.

So I first created created a powershell script to help me out on this and later to an Outlook AddIn.

The code is lacking of some comments and probably this functionality could be achieved in a better and mode efficient way but I am claiming that this is a finished effort, on the contrary, I would like to receive feedbacks and/or contributions from the community so we could come up with something more robust and comprehensive.

I have not figure it out how to add screenshots to github, so go to my webpage, http://hlsbinarysolutions.com/blog to find a more descriptive how-to.
